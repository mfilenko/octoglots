Find GitHub users based on the languages of repositories they own.

To do:
* Create a service which provides a single API endpoint to search for GitHub users by the programming language they use in their public repositories.
* Each user returned in the response of the search request should at least contain the username, name, avatar url and number of followers.
* Use the GitHub APIs (https://developer.github.com/v3/) to retrieve the information.
* The service should be developed with Node.js. Feel free to use any libraries you find suitable for this task.
* The service should be covered with tests you find suitable for this task.
* Create a Dockerfile to run the service.
* Please use Git for this project. After you finished, create a zip archive of the repository and send it via email.
* The goal isn't to build a ready product, but rather to get an idea of your skills. Most people spent no longer than four hours.
